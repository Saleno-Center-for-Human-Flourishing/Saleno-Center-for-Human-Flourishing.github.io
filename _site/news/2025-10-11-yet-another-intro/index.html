<p>The BGG foundation is dedicated to empowering youth through video-gaming. We have recently begun to develop a 12-week philosophy course that uses Mass-Multiplayer video games to help students to better understand the concept of ethical reasoning. This includes understanding which considerations shape their ethical responses (Croft), the ethical dimensions of meaning and purpose foundational to philosophical tradition, be able to think independently and creatively about the human condition (e.g., living-well, moral value, intellectual virtue).</p>
<p>The Love Ethic project by Notre Dame sums this up nicely:</p>
<p>“Love Ethic Collaborations are open to scholars who are conducting a substantial research project that advances our theoretical understanding of a dimension of love-based ethical frameworks.”</p>
<p>What is one way to advance our theoretical understanding of a dimension of love-based ethical frameworks?</p>
<p>I want to have students model ethical frameworks in open world&nbsp;game&nbsp;play. Why?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What both <em>metis</em> and Platonic self-sufficiency omit is a picture of excellence that is shown to us in the traditional image of <em>arete</em> as plant: a kind of human worth that is inseparable from vulnerability, an excellence that is in its nature other-related and social, a rationality who nature it is <em>not</em> to attempt to seize, hold, trap, and control, in whose values openness, receptivity, and wonder play an important part. <span class="citation" data-cites="nuss86i">(<a href="#ref-nuss86i" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>nuss86i?</strong></a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a reliance on external objects taht will recive “the excellent activity”, others to receive the agent’s generosity, good activity connected with citizenship and political attachment as well as personal love and friendship <span class="citation" data-cites="nuss86i">(<a href="#ref-nuss86i" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>nuss86i?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It is largely been argued that these relationships can be cultivated through narratives.</p>
<p>Our program will use video games to develop philosophical explorations in the areas of ethics and aesthetics for high school and junior undergraduate students. Tragedy and other art enable us to appreciate how our ethical commitments can sometimes conflict with more fundamental commitments: moral attachments, meaningful relationships (parent / child, spouse etc). We argue that when combined with carefully selected reading materials, role-playing in virtual video-game environments can double as executable thought experiments that resemble critical dilemmas in assigned literature. These would, for instance, model ethical dilemmas and cultivate moral reasoning by using MMO’s abilities to model and create felt presence, leading participants through sequences of events which reflect how one experiences the real world in all its moral philosophical complexity.</p>

<p>This chapter aims to increase educators’ effectiveness for using VR in the classroom by helping them leverage the affordance of presence in learning experiences. Research findings on the sense of presence are utilized to provide structure for an exploration of considerations and questions educators should address as they plan virtual experiences for learners. Because devices come and go so quickly, there are not specific recommendations for devices or activities; rather, a structured guide for considering the affordance of the sense of presence when teaching and learning with VR is offered.</p>

<p>VR has the potential to support other student populations who may be rural or low-income, thus providing greater equity, inclusivity, and access to overcome the socioeconomic restrictions underrepresented students face in their development of global citizenship. To facilitate the effective use and adoption of VR, the results of multiple case studies using a concurrent triangulation design are presented, which outline the pedagogical strategies that may be adopted in a number of areas.</p>

To address this need, we provide a theoretical lens to help the education and training communities evaluate exist ing and future research in I-VR.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Researchers on The Developing Minds and Digital Media project interviewed forty experienced and articulate high school educators (drawn from sixteen elite New England schools with an average of twenty-three years in the classroom) about what types of changes, if any, they had observed in their students over time. Our team devoted special attention to changes in routine (non-social) cognition, social cognition, and moral and ethical priorities as they relate to new digital media (NDM) engagement. The project’s findings are nuanced and encompass a wide range of behaviors. To capture our conclusions succinctly, we determined that NDM encourage certain tasks and behaviors and discourage others – the archetypal ‘mixed blessing.’ Much of the tension derives from how students deal with the often overwhelming volume of information and practices of social networking online.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“How do Boston-area youth (15–25) reason about ethical dilemmas occurring within virtual worlds such as ‘World of Warcraft’?”; and “Which considerations seem to shape their ethical responses?” In semi-structured interviews 27 young people were presented with an ethical dilemma: subjects were asked to imagine that they had been playing an online multiplayer game of around 30,000 players for two weeks. Within the imagined game, they are asked whether or not they would join their online friends in selling “Pseudogems”—worthless items that are thought to be valuable by new players—to others in the gameworld. The responses of our participants suggest that most young people (13 of 27) would sell the gems, while 8 would not, with 6 giving a mixed response.</p>
