    "text": "Measurement of the two distinct components—scattering and absorption—of a single particle’s optical extinction provides fundamentally important and complementary information on how that object processes light: either scattering it back to the far-field or converting it into internal excitation. Yet measurement and separation of each is an extraordinarily difficult experimental task. Far-field optical spectroscopies and microscopies are also limited by diffraction, which further restricts the amount of information attainable. In spite of these constraints, we combine ideas from photothermal heterodyne imaging and plasmon-enhanced super-resolution imaging to correlate the absorption spectra of individual nanoscopic objects with their precise locations below the diffraction limit. Active far-field manipulation and control of the thermal near-field in engineered metamaterials extends this work in new directions that we are currently exploring in collaboration with multiple experimental teams."

    "text": "Wendy Laybourn (2018) proposes a criticism of black authenticity and what she calls commodified realness. According to Laybourn, identity is sold to a broader public as black authenticity. This criticism is centered around the effects of what she calls controlling images in popular media. Of deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations and not in themselves harmful. Yet too, this is also a common trope, as old as society.\nI present this case as an example of a paradigmatic concept of hermeneutic injustice. It is not clear just what aspects of the member’s lives are represented, nor specifically which images are harmful if such images are accepted as representative. An important question here has to do with the relationship between popular narratives that contain these images, and personal identity. One approach argues that we are defined by the stories we accept about ourselves, but this is controversial.\nIt is not necessarily clear where to find the literature on specifically what is at issue here. Because of this, I think it will be helpful to start with something of an analogy, specifically one from the popular narrative.\nIn the newest Wicked screen adaptation, there is an underlying story line. The protagonist, the ‘wicked’ witch finally comes to accept that she will never be accepted by the broader public and as such, will always stand out as a scapegoat of sorts owing to her dark green skin. Therefore she fully leans into her ‘wicked’ persona.\nHowever, perhaps a detail which could not be included as prominently in Gregory Maguires 1995 novel. The amazing actress, Cynthia Erivo, is an African American with especially prominent African, accentuated owing to the excellent applied makeup and superb acting by Evrivo, features. Through both movies, it is obvious that she isn’t green in reality, but African American. We see the story of the witch as a case of othering. As such, especially poignant was the moment when Dorothy, believing the witch can be killed throws a bucket of water on her, an old racist trope about African Americans and bathing.\nIt is a fortunate accident I suppose, director John M. Chu taking perfect advantage of the fact that the witch in the original dies having had a bucket of water thrown onto her. The witch, fully adopting her role, seemingly for the good of the people of Oz, ‘dies’, but in the fiction, merely goes into hiding.\nUltimately Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, turned Straw man, strike out to the desert after her sacrificial death accepting that they will forever be scapegoats should they choose to stay in Oz.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLaybourn, Wendy M. 2018. “The Cost of Being ‘Real’: Black Authenticity, Colourism, and Billboard Rap Chart Rankings.” Ethnic and Racial Studies 41 (11): 2085–2103. https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2017.1343484."

    "text": "The Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.\nIn the 57th question of the 1st of the second part of the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas defends the view of art as a form of right reason. There is a distinction here between right reason for making objects, and right reason for doing good actions. We should first focus on the point that important to both of these activities, is the right use of one’s cognitive faculties. The difference lies in the produced object, whether an action or thing.\nConsidering a product that is produced, the desired outcome of the activity of art, it is not clear what it is exactly, that we care about in the case of art. When it comes to what is produced in the case of art, it is not clear whether the final thing produced is an action, or a material commodity. The common contemporary understanding considers various perspectives. However, it is important to understand two important points here.\nPiñero Moral (2021) argues that this is because art’s purpose in the middle ages is to represent reality. It is one thing to accurately and factually represent a tree, however, Pinero is talking about more complex reality, especially moral reality.\nOne example of medieval representations of moral reality include the Persian Manticore.\nThe manticore as depicted in medieval art is said to represent evil. There are several ways in which some art object may represent more complex realities. One may think that the purpose of a painting is to reflect the experiences one had during a war, or peace time event. Such a painting may express the given facts of the case, for instance an artist could paint the signing of the Magna Carta. If the painting were painted by an artist who was alive to witness the signing of the Magna Carta, then the artist would merely be representing contemporary reality. If the art were not alive at the time, then we could argue that the artist is represeting historical reality. If the artist is relying on trusted sources that are well-known, then this would be different than if the artist were imagining an event which not many direct sources exist. But an artist can represent a projection of reality as well when the reality they want to convey is obscure, not well known, highly contested etc.\n\nBy definition, medieval art implies metaphysical aspirations and normative elements (De Bruyne 1959). Its commitment with reality is undeniable yet the reality which it attempts to represent is so complex and vast that the limits between what is and what is not, between what we believe and what we know, between what we are and what we wish to be, are often blurred. (Cronin 1941)\n\nHere, the artist can represent facts as they believe them to be, or as they wish them to be. It is this latter motivation that Pinero suggests motivated medieval artwork representing the manticore.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPiñero Moral, Ricardo. 2021. “Aesthetics of Evil in Middle Ages: Beasts as Symbol of the Devil.” Religions 12 (957, 11). https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12110957."

    "text": "The BGG foundation is dedicated to empowering youth through video-gaming. We have recently begun to develop a 12-week philosophy course that uses Mass-Multiplayer video games to help students to better understand the concept of ethical reasoning. This includes understanding which considerations shape their ethical responses (Croft), the ethical dimensions of meaning and purpose foundational to philosophical tradition, be able to think independently and creatively about the human condition (e.g., living-well, moral value, intellectual virtue).\nThe Love Ethic project by Notre Dame sums this up nicely:\n“Love Ethic Collaborations are open to scholars who are conducting a substantial research project that advances our theoretical understanding of a dimension of love-based ethical frameworks.”\nWhat is one way to advance our theoretical understanding of a dimension of love-based ethical frameworks?\nI want to have students model ethical frameworks in open world game play. Why?\nThis is a reliance on external objects taht will recive “the excellent activity”, others to receive the agent’s generosity, good activity connected with citizenship and political attachment as well as personal love and friendship (nuss86i?).\nIt is largely been argued that these relationships can be cultivated through narratives.\nOur program will use video games to develop philosophical explorations in the areas of ethics and aesthetics for high school and junior undergraduate students. Tragedy and other art enable us to appreciate how our ethical commitments can sometimes conflict with more fundamental commitments: moral attachments, meaningful relationships (parent / child, spouse etc). We argue that when combined with carefully selected reading materials, role-playing in virtual video-game environments can double as executable thought experiments that resemble critical dilemmas in assigned literature. These would, for instance, model ethical dilemmas and cultivate moral reasoning by using MMO’s abilities to model and create felt presence, leading participants through sequences of events which reflect how one experiences the real world in all its moral philosophical complexity."

Research findings on the sense of presence are utilized to provide structure for an exploration of considerations and questions educators should address as they plan virtual experiences for learners. Because devices come and go so quickly, there are not specific recommendations for devices or activities; rather, a structured guide for considering the affordance of the sense of presence when teaching and learning with VR is offered.\n\n\nWhat educators should think about\nQuestions one should ask about learners and devices\nhow to relate to learners through experience\n\n\n\nRemoving Barriers of Space and Time to Immerse Students in Virtual Learning Environments\nJames Hutson\n\nVR has the potential to support other student populations who may be rural or low-income, thus providing greater equity, inclusivity, and access to overcome the socioeconomic restrictions underrepresented students face in their development of global citizenship. To facilitate the effective use and adoption of VR, the results of multiple case studies using a concurrent triangulation design are presented, which outline the pedagogical strategies that may be adopted in a number of areas.\n\n\nScaffold immersive learning experiences\nAligning learning activity based on participants and instrutors\n\n\nFor further research\n\nThe results from the two studies confirm earlier research on the positive correlation between the use of VR and increased enjoyment in learning and improved motivation, which leads to deeper learning and long-term retention of material (Brownridge, 2020; Cheung et al. 2013; Huang et al., 2010; Hussein & Nätterdal, 2015; Jacobson & Lewis, 2005; Rizzo et al. 2006; Sharma et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\nTheory of Learning in Immersive Environments and 4E Cognition\nGREGORY MCGOWIN University of Central Florida, USA gmcgowin@knights.ucf.edu STEPHEN M.

To address this need, we provide a theoretical lens to help the education and training communities evaluate exist ing and future research in I-VR.

Auburn St. Cambridge, MA 02138 margaret_weigel@pz.harvard.edu celka_straughn@pz.harvard.edu\n\nResearchers on The Developing Minds and Digital Media project interviewed forty experienced and articulate high school educators (drawn from sixteen elite New England schools with an average of twenty-three years in the classroom) about what types of changes, if any, they had observed in their students over time. Our team devoted special attention to changes in routine (non-social) cognition, social cognition, and moral and ethical priorities as they relate to new digital media (NDM) engagement. The project’s findings are nuanced and encompass a wide range of behaviors. To capture our conclusions succinctly, we determined that NDM encourage certain tasks and behaviors and discourage others – the archetypal ‘mixed blessing.’ Much of the tension derives from how students deal with the often overwhelming volume of information and practices of social networking online.\n\n\n\n“It’s Just a Game”—Ethical Reasoning within Virtual Worlds\nJames Croft\n\n“How do Boston-area youth (15–25) reason about ethical dilemmas occurring within virtual worlds such as ‘World of Warcraft’?”; and “Which considerations seem to shape their ethical responses?” In semi-structured interviews 27 young people were presented with an ethical dilemma: subjects were asked to imagine that they had been playing an online multiplayer game of around 30,000 players for two weeks. Within the imagined game, they are asked whether or not they would join their online friends in selling “Pseudogems”—worthless items that are thought to be valuable by new players—to others in the gameworld. The responses of our participants suggest that most young people (13 of 27) would sell the gems, while 8 would not, with 6 giving a mixed response."

It consists in reasoning from a supposition that is not accepted as true—perhaps is even known to be false—but is assumed provisionally in the interests of making a point or resolving a conclusion.\n\n\nIt is to be shown that P is the case (where it has not yet been established whether P or not -P).\nAssume—as “thought experiment”—that P is the case (which is not inherently implausible).\nExplain Q on the basis of this assumption, where Q is something patently true which we could not readily explain otherwise.\nHence maintain that P.\n\n\n\nThought Experiment Two\nJohn Norton (1991):\nThought experiments are arguments which:\n\nPosit hypothetical or counterfactual states of affairs, and\nInvoke particulars irrelevant to the generanlity of the conclusion.\n\n\nhypothetical or counterfactual opposite of actual.\nirrelevant particulars irrelevant to the conclusion.\n\n\nThus, in one version of the thought experiement in which Einsteinn sought to demonstrate that the effects of acceleration mimic those of gravitation, he asked us to imagine a physicist-observer who has been drugged and reawakens closed up inside a box (Einstein, 1912, pp. 1254-55). . . . Without particulars such as these, however, thought experiments would not have their experimental appearance.\n\nGood thought experiments are good arguments. Either:\n\nThe particular-free conclusion follows deductively form the premisses. Thought experiments of this type are typically reductio arguments.\nThe conclusion is freed of the particulars by an inductive step. This step might involve the assertion that the case involving the particulars is ‘typical’ or that the particulars are ‘inessential,’ so that the result derived holds in other cases as well."

(Short, Williams, and Christie, 1976)” , (5).\nPresence as realism: “presence is the degree to which a medium can produce seemingly accurate representations of objects, events, and people—representations that look, sound, and/or feel like the ‘real’ thing” (6).\nPresence as transportation: “user is transported to another place”.\nPresence as immersion: “the degree to which the virtual environment submerges the perceptual system of the user” (Biocca & Delaney, 1995, p. 57).\nPresence as social actor within medium: user’s responses “to social cues presented by persons they encounter within a medium even though it is illogical and even inappropriate to do so”.

Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of such thermal conduction. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and local chemical reaction control to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.\nWith support from the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University, and Professor Stephan Link from Rice University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of materials capable of controllably directing temperature increases to nanoscale regions of space using light. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.",

    "text": "Simulating the Good Life\nMost important among the underlying comments of Platonic and Aristotelian views of rational self-sufficiency, is the view that art uniquely enables reflection on what amounts to a beautiful human life. Taking the concept of art and interpreting it broadly, MMOs fit this category. The difference here is that we intend to use MMOs as art in the pursuit of being able to reflect on a beautiful life. Consider the game One Hour One Life by Jason Rohrer. One Hour is a multiplayer survival game whose players must depend on other players in their early years. A player begins as a helpless baby and their continued play depends on the kindness of other players. However, the more individuals in a given community who can work well together, the better that community fairs in the long run. So the sacrifice that community members make in the early years of a member’s life, become an investment in the long run."

    "text": "Rebeka Davis\n\nThis chapter aims to increase educators’ effectiveness for using VR in the classroom by helping them leverage the affordance of presence in learning experiences. Research findings on the sense of presence are utilized to provide structure for an exploration of considerations and questions edu cators should address as they plan virtual experiences for learners. Because devices come and go so quickly, there are not specific recommendations for devices or activities; rather, a structured guide for considering the affordance of the sense of presence when teaching and learning with VR is offered.\n\n\nWhat educators should think about\nQuestions one should ask about learners and devices\nhow to relate to learners through experience\n\n\n\n\nJames Hutson\n\nVR has the potential to support other student populations who may be rural or low-income, thus providing greater equity, inclusivity, and access to overcome the socioeconomic restric tions underrepresented students face in their development of global citizenship. To facilitate the effective use and adoption of VR, the results of multiple case studies using a concurrent triangulation design are present ed, which outline the pedagogical strategies that may be adopted in a number of areas.\n\n\nScaffold immersive learning experiences\nAligning learning activity based on participants and instrutors\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the two studies confirm earlier research on the positive correlation between the use of VR and increased enjoyment in learning and improved motivation, which leads to deeper learning and long-term retention of material (Brownridge, 2020; Cheung et al. 2013; Huang et al., 2010; Hussein & Nätterdal, 2015; Jacobson & Lewis, 2005; Rizzo et al. 2006; Sharma et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\nGREGORY MCGOWIN University of Central Florida, USA gmcgowin@knights.ucf.edu STEPHEN M.

Research findings on the sense of presence are utilized to provide structure for an exploration of considerations and questions edu cators should address as they plan virtual experiences for learners. Because devices come and go so quickly, there are not specific recommendations for devices or activities; rather, a structured guide for considering the affordance of the sense of presence when teaching and learning with VR is offered.\n\n\nWhat educators should think about\nQuestions one should ask about learners and devices\nhow to relate to learners through experience\n\n\n\n\nJames Hutson\n\nVR has the potential to support other student populations who may be rural or low-income, thus providing greater equity, inclusivity, and access to overcome the socioeconomic restric tions underrepresented students face in their development of global citizenship. To facilitate the effective use and adoption of VR, the results of multiple case studies using a concurrent triangulation design are present ed, which outline the pedagogical strategies that may be adopted in a number of areas.\n\n\nScaffold immersive learning experiences\nAligning learning activity based on participants and instrutors\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the two studies confirm earlier research on the positive correlation between the use of VR and increased enjoyment in learning and improved motivation, which leads to deeper learning and long-term retention of material (Brownridge, 2020; Cheung et al. 2013; Huang et al., 2010; Hussein & Nätterdal, 2015; Jacobson & Lewis, 2005; Rizzo et al. 2006; Sharma et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\nGREGORY MCGOWIN University of Central Florida, USA gmcgowin@knights.ucf.edu STEPHEN M.

    "text": "In a previous post, I highlighted some concerns raised by Laybourn (2018) regarding representation and authenticity. Here, I want to draw attention to some additional similar concerns. I then raise me own concerns, I specify that these criticisms unfairly focus too narrowly on the black experience and do not do a good enough job in recognizing that these experiences are universal. Given their universality, I argue that a best response is found in a Christian theodicy to evil. I draw on the psychological literature of in-group and out-group behavior.\n\nWendy Laybourn (2018) proposes a criticism of black authenticity and what she calls commodified realness. According to Laybourn, identity is sold to a broader public as black authenticity. This criticism is centered around the effects of what she calls controlling images in popular media. Of deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations and not in themselves harmful. Yet too, this is also a common trope, as old as society.\n\nSome similar examples of this criticism can be found in Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020) or Mbembe (2017)’s Critque of Black Reason. Jackson (2020) defends the view of race as a social construct. Here black represents a void of reason and a surplus of animality. It is not clear what the counter to this claim should be as it is not represented anywhere in either work. However, looking at what is deemed black culture broadly in popular media, this counter claim is even more difficult to understand given that many African Americans fail to explicitly and publicly criticize, or at the very least, argue that such behaviors are not culturally representative. Popular artists who reflect similar characteristics as those deemed synonymous to the black race are praised and vaunted. Black female artists for instance, who reinforce stereotypes of blacks as hypersexualized, vulgar, using codes such as twerking to exemplify their over hyper-sexualized nature, are praised as empowering or authentic, where as black male artists are praised as being “real” or “gritty” for expression unjustified violence directed at other blacks. But this is just to mimic the age old racist justifications for slavery although slavery, in name, has been outlawed. According to this justification, blackness represents a blurred distinction between human and animal.\n\nMan distinguishes himself from animality, but this is not the case for the Black Man, who maintains within himself, albeit with a certain degree of ambiguity, animal possibility. A foreign body in our world, he is inhabited­under cover—by the animal. To debate Black reason is therefore to return to the collection of debates regarding the rules of how to define the Black Man: how he is recognized, how one identifies the animal spirit that possesses him, ­under which conditions the ratio penetrates and governs the animalitas. (Mbembe 2017, 56)\n\nA very famous example of just such an exchange occurred between the Reverend Calvin Butts who highlights serious objects to black representation in gangster rap, and the artist known as Ice T (20C History Project 2014) who gave voice to an entire generation who completely misses the point. The question that remains is what the justifications of such representations useful for now since slavery has been outlawed? What is less clear, is what to make of those African Americans who praise artists such as Tupac, Lizzo, Cardi B., Megan Thee Stalion. Like Ice T, they represent a view that has not grasped the similarity between using notions of black animality to justify, for instance, taking children away from their parents to sell to a sugar plantation. The question here is what artist representations of black animality now justify?\nA possibility may be the use of fetal tissue for medical research. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion for Box v. Planned Parenthood. In it, he argued that the United States’ history of eugenics provided strong justification for an Indiana law that banned abortions solely on the race, gender, or disability of the fetus. Much of his reasoning stems from the disparity in abortion rates between black women versus all other women. In 2021, reporting from the CDC shows that non-hispanic black women accounted for 41.5% of all abortions (Kortsmit 2023). While that may not seem like a lot, it must be pointed out that black women make up only between 13.6% to 15.5% of all U.S. women (Chinn, Martin, and Redmond 2021).\n\nRoe and Casey held that a pregnant woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion; that that right may be exercised for essentially whatever reason the woman sees fit; and that the state may not make or enforce laws that have the purpose or effect of inhibiting the woman’s abortion choice.\n\nAs noted at the outset of this Response, laws prohibiting trait-selection abortion conflict in principle with Roe and Casey’s establishment of a constitutional right to abortion for any reason the woman chooses.\nDoes the right to abortion hold even if the reason for abortion is the race, gender, or disability of the child? According to Roe v. Wade, it does. But this is problematic.\n\nWhere race, sex, or disability can be shown to be the reason for a particular abortion, can such an abortion constitutionally be prohibited? Is the Court irrevocably committed to a doctrine that would compel toleration of eugenics-motivated abortion as a constitutional right? Or is there a sensible road back?\n\n\nRights have reasons, if the right outruns to proffered reason, then there is a good reason to limit or narrow the right.\n\n\nWhere the formulation of a right — and especially of an unwritten right — outruns the reasons proffered for that right, there is good reason to limit or narrow it.\n\nBuilding on Eisenstadt v. Baird, Roe v. Wade is a ruling on the protection of a person’s decision to be a parent or to not be a parent. But eugenics based motivations are a different kind of decision, about what kind of child the person decides to be a parent to.\n\nTo ban sex-selection (or race-motivated, or disability-based) abortion is not to interfere with the choice of whether or not to have a child — the right Roe and Casey seem to have in view — but to interfere with the choice to abort where continued pregnancy and childbirth otherwise would be chosen, but for reasons of the traits of the child to be born.\n\nRoe v. Wade overshoots the reasons supporting Eisenstadt v. Baird.\n\nUse undue burden language to limit scope of “relevant rights” in roe and casey.\n\n\nIt seems fair to observe, however, that the “undue burden” formula is vague, amorphous, malleable, and adjustable. In a scheme of judicial development of an unwritten right, it should be open to the Court to conclude that prohibitions on trait-specific abortions do not burden in a relevant way the right to abortion itself, but only the right to trait selection of born children through the means of abortion.\n\nIn other words, point out that the language in roe and casey do not burden decision to abort, but only one reason for aborting a fetus.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n20C History Project, dir. 2014.

Of deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations and not in themselves harmful. Yet too, this is also a common trope, as old as society.\nI present this case as an example of a paradigmatic concept of hermeneutic injustice. It is not clear just what aspects of the member’s lives are represented, nor specifically which images are harmful if such images are accepted as representative. An important question here has to do with the relationship between popular narratives that contain these images, and personal identity. One approach argues that we are defined by the stories we accept about ourselves, but this is controversial.\nIt is not necessarily clear where to find the literature on specifically what is at issue here. Because of this, I think it will be helpful to start with something of an analogy, specifically one from the popular narrative.\nIn the newest Wicked screen adaptation, there is an underlying story line. The protagonist, the ‘wicked’ witch finally comes to accept that she will never be accepted by the broader public and as such, will always stand out as a scapegoat of sorts owing to her dark green skin. Therefore she fully leans into her ‘wicked’ persona.\nHowever, perhaps a detail which could not be included as prominently in Gregory Maguires 1995 novel. The amazing actress, Cynthia Erivo, is an African American with especially prominent African, accentuated owing to the excellent applied makeup and superb acting by Evrivo, features. Through both movies, it is obvious that she isn’t green in reality, but African American. We see the story of the witch as a case of othering. As such, especially poignant was the moment when Dorothy, believing the witch can be killed throws a bucket of water on her, an old racist trope about African Americans and bathing.\nIt is a fortunate accident I suppose, director John M. Chu taking perfect advantage of the fact that the witch in the original dies having had a bucket of water thrown onto her. The witch, fully adopting her role, seemingly for the good of the people of Oz, ‘dies’, but in the fiction, merely goes into hiding.\nUltimately Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, turned Straw man, strike out to the desert after her sacrificial death accepting that they will forever be scapegoats should they choose to stay in Oz.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLaybourn, Wendy M. 2018. “The Cost of Being ‘Real’: Black Authenticity, Colourism, and Billboard Rap Chart Rankings.” Ethnic and Racial Studies 41 (11): 2085–2103. https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2017.1343484."

    "text": "Coupling between light and matter is extraordinarily weak. Optical resonator cavities provide an opportunity to coax repeated light-matter interactions, thereby enhancing coupling far beyond that of free space. In such settings, coupling can be so strong that it is no longer possible to disentangle the original optical and material degrees of freedom, resulting in non-equilibrium quantum optical states endowed with properties beyond those of their components. Together with experiment we develop theoretical models and simulation tools necessary to explicitly connect nanophotonic cavity + qubit systems with quantum many-body processes and phenomena. Our work not only enables the simulation of quantum many-body physics in nanophotonic devices but also provides opportunities to protect fragile quantum correlations against decoherence."
